RL-Kernel bridges high-level alignment algorithms and low-level hardware optimizations.
It targets GRPO, PPO, DPO, and other reinforcement learning post-training workloads where
log probability computation, sampling, and memory pressure dominate the critical path.

Where to get started depends on the type of user:

- Run RL-Kernel locally with the [Quickstart Guide](./getting_started/quickstart.md).
- Read the latest writeup: [Announcing RL-Kernel for vime](./blog/2026-07-08-announcing-rl-kernel-linear-logp-for-vime.md).
- Read the [DeepSeek V4 Flash MoE operator consistency roadmap](./design/deepseek-v4-flash-moe-operator-consistency-roadmap-zh.md).
- Understand supported kernels from the [Operators](./operators/README.md) section.
- Add a new operator by following the [Developer Guide](./contributing/README.md).
- Read dispatch details in the [Runtime Dispatch design document](./design/runtime-dispatch.md).

RL-Kernel focuses on:

- Hardware-aware dispatch for CUDA, ROCm, and PyTorch fallback paths.
- Fused GPU operators for post-training bottlenecks.
- Operator documentation as part of the merge contract.
- A documentation structure that can grow with the project as more operators,
  runtime features, benchmarks, and APIs are added.
